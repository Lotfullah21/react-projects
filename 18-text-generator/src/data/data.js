    title: "Origins of AI",
    content:
      "The dawn of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be traced back to the mid-20th century when visionary computer scientists and mathematicians, including Alan Turing (1950), proposed the Turing Test. This pivotal concept challenged machines to engage in natural language conversations indistinguishable from those with humans, setting the stage for AI's transformative journey. Turing's work not only laid the philosophical foundation for AI but also inspired the development of early AI systems, such as the Logic Theorist and the General Problem Solver.",
